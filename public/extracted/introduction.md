# Benjamin Stein - Introduction

In my journey through healthcare technology, I've evolved from a Clinical Analyst I at Advanced ICU Care to my current role as a Clinical Informatics Specialist at Homer G. Phillips Memorial Hospital. As a pioneer at Homer G. Phillips, I spearheaded the implementation and maintenance of crucial systems like our EHR platform (Thrive) and Google Enterprise. Tasked with on/off-boarding users and troubleshooting a spectrum of IT challenges, I've honed my skills in managing EMR interfaces and conducting detailed analysis to ensure seamless operations.

My growth trajectory saw me at Shriners Hospital for Children, refining my expertise as a Clinical Analyst II. Here, I led the integration of new functionalities within the Cerner suite, empowering clinical staff with tailored training and robust support. Delving into SAP Business Objects and overseeing PC maintenance schedules with precision, I embraced the intricacies of healthcare information systems, from Epic to HL7 messaging. This hands-on experience solidified my commitment to efficient and secure data management practices.

Looking ahead, I am driven by the core belief that all healthcare professionals should prioritize continuous learning and adaptive problem-solving. My goal is to leverage my skills in management, analysis, and clinical informatics to enhance operational efficiencies and elevate patient care standards. I aspire to bring a blend of technical acumen and compassionate leadership to my next role, contributing meaningfully to the dynamic landscape of healthcare technology.

Warm regards,
