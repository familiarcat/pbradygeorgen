# Benjamin Stein - Introduction

With a career journey spanning from Clinical Analyst roles to the current position as a Clinical Informatics Specialist, I have honed my skills in EHR systems, EMR analysis, and HIPAA compliance. My commitment to meticulous training, effective management, and continuous learning underscores my professional ethos. Upholding integrity, confidentiality, and accuracy in all aspects of clinical informatics is paramount to me.
