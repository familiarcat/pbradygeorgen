This directory contains documentation and diagrams that visualize the architecture of our application, with a focus on the philosophical approaches that guide our design decisions.

## Documentation Resources

### [Comprehensive Architecture Reference](./ARCHITECTURE.md)

A comprehensive reference document that combines process-oriented diagrams with detailed explanations of the application architecture, including:

- Philosophical approach
- System overview
- Content processing flow
- Server-side formatting process
- Race condition prevention process
- Component interaction process
- Caching strategy
- Deployment architecture

The diagrams in this document can be zoomed, panned, and exported to PNG, SVG, or PDF for closer inspection.

## Philosophical Framework

Our application architecture is guided by four philosophical approaches, each represented by a distinct color and shape in our diagrams:

- **Hesse Philosophy (Teal)**: Structure and balance - Applied to core services and data structures
- **Salinger Philosophy (Purple)**: Authenticity and narrative - Applied to user interfaces and experiences
- **Derrida Philosophy (Red)**: Deconstruction and analysis - Applied to content processing and caching
- **Dante Philosophy (Yellow)**: Navigation and guidance - Applied to logging and error handling

## Viewing the Diagrams

These diagrams can be viewed in VSCode using the Mermaid extension or any other Mermaid-compatible viewer.
