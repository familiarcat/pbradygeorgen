# Archived Scripts

This directory contains scripts that are no longer actively used in the project but are preserved for reference.

## Why Archive?

Following Hesse's philosophy of balance, we maintain equilibrium between preserving historical code and maintaining a clean project structure.

## Usage

If you need to use one of these scripts, consider moving it back to the main scripts directory or refactoring its functionality into a current script.
