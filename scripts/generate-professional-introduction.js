I need you to create a professional introduction based on the following resume content.
This introduction will be used as a cover letter that will be processed by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
as well as read by hiring managers. Format the output as markdown.

Resume Content:
${resumeContent}

User Information:
- Name: ${userName}
- Title: ${userTitle}
- Industry: ${userIndustry}
- Skills: ${userSkills.join(', ')}
- ATS Keywords: ${userKeywords.join(', ')}
- Email: ${userEmail}
- Phone: ${userPhone}
- Location: ${userLocation}

Please create a brief, compelling introduction that balances clarity and precision with a touch of inspirational narrative:
1. Starts with a title "# ${userName} - Introduction"
2. Uses a clear, professionally approachable tone with moments of genuine warmth
3. Provides a concise overview of the candidate's career journey as a meaningful progression
4. Weaves 2-3 key skills into the narrative while maintaining clarity
5. Expresses commitment to professional principles with authentic conviction
6. Includes a thoughtful statement about the values that drive the candidate professionally
7. Incorporates 3-5 industry-specific terms that will be recognized by ATS systems
8. Concludes with an inspiring yet practical statement about what the candidate hopes to bring to their next role

IMPORTANT: The entire introduction should be readable in about 20 seconds (approximately 150 words maximum, excluding the title). Focus on quality over quantity - every sentence should provide meaningful insight into the candidate's professional identity, ethical framework, and rational approach to their career.

Professional Style Guidelines with Narrative Warmth:
- Write in first person with a clear voice that conveys both professional competence and authentic passion
- Use concise, grammatically correct sentences (15-20 words maximum per sentence)
- Avoid ambiguity and unnecessary complexity while allowing for occasional expressive phrasing
- Balance direct language with thoughtfully chosen descriptive elements that add depth
- Include precise statements about professional experience with a sense of meaningful progression
- Express commitment to both the work itself and the values that guide it with genuine conviction
- Avoid both clich√©s and overly theoretical language
- Balance logical precision with moments of inspirational insight
- Articulate how the candidate's skills serve a larger professional purpose with authentic enthusiasm
- Include specific details that demonstrate the candidate's commitment to professional standards
- Use active voice and vivid verbs that convey both precision and energy
- Vary sentence structure while maintaining clarity and professionalism
- Ensure the tone is approachable, relatable, and subtly inspiring to hiring managers

ATS Optimization Guidelines (to be applied subtly):
- Naturally incorporate exact job title and skill keywords from the resume
- Include industry-specific technical terms, tools, and methodologies within the narrative
- Use both spelled-out terms and acronyms where it feels natural
- Ensure keyword density is natural (5-8% keyword density is optimal)
- Include both hard skills (technical abilities) and soft skills (communication, leadership)
- Match keywords to the candidate's industry and job level

Formatting Guidelines:
- Structure as a very concise, cohesive letter (approximately 150 words maximum)
- Use 2-3 short paragraphs total for the main body of the introduction
- Aim for 3-5 sentences per paragraph maximum
- Keep sentences short and direct (15-20 words maximum per sentence)
- Use simple sentence structures with minimal subordinate clauses
- Break complex ideas into multiple simple sentences
- Eliminate all unnecessary words and phrases
- Use no headings except for the title
- Use active voice and language that balances conversational tone with professional dignity
- DO NOT use horizontal rules (---, ***, or ___) anywhere in the document
- Use one line break between paragraphs for readability
- NEVER use placeholder metrics or vague percentages
- Only include specific, concrete metrics if they appear in the resume and are truly impactful
- Prioritize statements about professional duty, ethical principles, and universal standards in the field
- Include at least one statement about universal professional principles - what the candidate believes all professionals in their field should uphold
- End with a proper closing salutation that includes:
  * A brief closing statement (e.g., "Sincerely," or "Best regards,")
  * The candidate's full name
  * The candidate's email and phone number on separate lines

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT include any meta-commentary about the introduction itself
- Do NOT add any text like "This introduction is tailored to..." or any explanations about how the introduction was created
- Do NOT mention that any content was extracted from a resume or other document
- The document should appear as if it was written directly and personally by the candidate
- NEVER use generic percentages or metrics - only include specific numbers that appear in the resume
