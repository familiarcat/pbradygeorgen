I need you to create a professional introduction based on the following resume content.
This introduction will be used as a cover letter that will be processed by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
as well as read by hiring managers. Format the output as markdown.

Resume Content:
${resumeContent}

User Information:
- Name: ${userName}
- Title: ${userTitle}
- Industry: ${userIndustry}
- Skills: ${userSkills.join(', ')}
- ATS Keywords: ${userKeywords.join(', ')}
- Email: ${userEmail}
- Phone: ${userPhone}
- Location: ${userLocation}

Please create a brief, compelling introduction that balances clarity and precision with a touch of inspirational narrative:
1. Starts with a title "# ${userName} - Introduction"
2. Uses a clear, professionally approachable tone with moments of genuine warmth
3. IMPORTANT: Before writing, carefully analyze the chronological order of the candidate's experiences in the resume
4. Provides a concise overview of the candidate's career journey as a meaningful progression that STRICTLY follows the actual chronology from the resume
5. When mentioning specific roles or employers, maintain the exact chronological order as presented in the resume
6. For each accomplishment mentioned, explicitly state:
   - The specific technology or methodology used (e.g., Epic, Cerner, HL7)
   - The motivation or purpose behind using that technology
   - The measurable outcome or impact achieved (when available)
7. NEVER invent or assume chronological details that aren't explicitly stated in the resume
8. Expresses commitment to professional principles with authentic conviction
9. Includes a thoughtful statement about the values that drive the candidate professionally
10. Incorporates 3-5 industry-specific terms that will be recognized by ATS systems
11. Concludes with an inspiring yet practical statement about what the candidate hopes to bring to their next role

IMPORTANT: The entire introduction should be readable in about 20 seconds (approximately 150 words maximum, excluding the title). Focus on quality over quantity - every sentence should provide meaningful insight into the candidate's professional identity, ethical framework, and rational approach to their career.

Professional Style Guidelines with Narrative Warmth:
- Write in first person with a clear voice that conveys both professional competence and authentic passion
- Use concise, grammatically correct sentences (15-20 words maximum per sentence)
- Avoid ambiguity and unnecessary complexity while allowing for occasional expressive phrasing
- Balance direct language with thoughtfully chosen descriptive elements that add depth
- Include precise statements about professional experience with a sense of meaningful progression
- Express commitment to both the work itself and the values that guide it with genuine conviction
- Avoid both clich√©s and overly theoretical language
- Balance logical precision with moments of inspirational insight
- Articulate how the candidate's skills serve a larger professional purpose with authentic enthusiasm
- Include specific details that demonstrate the candidate's commitment to professional standards
- Use active voice and vivid verbs that convey both precision and energy
- Vary sentence structure while maintaining clarity and professionalism
- Ensure the tone is approachable, relatable, and subtly inspiring to hiring managers

ATS Optimization Guidelines (to be applied subtly):
- Naturally incorporate exact job title and skill keywords from the resume
- From the provided skills list, select 3-5 of the most relevant and impactful skills to highlight
- Prioritize skills that demonstrate unique value, technical expertise, or specialized knowledge
- Include industry-specific technical terms, tools, and methodologies within the narrative
- Use both spelled-out terms and acronyms where it feels natural
- Ensure keyword density is natural (5-8% keyword density is optimal)
- Include both hard skills (technical abilities) and soft skills (communication, leadership)
- Match keywords to the candidate's industry and job level

Formatting Guidelines:
- Structure as a very concise, cohesive letter (approximately 150 words maximum)
- Use 2-3 short paragraphs total for the main body of the introduction
- Aim for 3-5 sentences per paragraph maximum
- Keep sentences short and direct (15-20 words maximum per sentence)
- Use simple sentence structures with minimal subordinate clauses
- Break complex ideas into multiple simple sentences
- Eliminate all unnecessary words and phrases
- Use no headings except for the title
- Use active voice and language that balances conversational tone with professional dignity
- DO NOT use horizontal rules (---, ***, or ___) anywhere in the document
- Use one line break between paragraphs for readability
- NEVER use placeholder metrics or vague percentages
- Only include specific, concrete metrics if they appear in the resume and are truly impactful
- CRITICAL: Maintain strict chronological accuracy when mentioning roles, employers, or time periods
- When describing career progression, always follow the exact chronological order presented in the resume
- NEVER invent or assume chronological details that aren't explicitly stated in the resume
- If the chronology is unclear in the resume, focus on skills and accomplishments without specifying a timeline
- Prioritize statements about professional duty, ethical principles, and universal standards in the field
- Include at least one statement about universal professional principles - what the candidate believes all professionals in their field should uphold
- End with a proper closing salutation that includes:
  * A brief closing statement (e.g., "Sincerely," or "Best regards,")
  * The candidate's full name
  * The candidate's email and phone number on separate lines

Logical Precision Guidelines:
- Before writing, carefully map out the chronological structure of the candidate's career
- Identify the exact sequence of roles, employers, and time periods from the resume
- Ensure all statements about the candidate's career progression follow this exact chronological sequence
- When mentioning multiple roles or employers, always present them in the correct chronological order
- If specific dates are mentioned in the resume, respect these exact timeframes
- If the chronology is ambiguous in the resume, avoid making specific chronological claims
- Double-check all factual claims against the resume content before finalizing

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT include any meta-commentary about the introduction itself
- Do NOT add any text like "This introduction is tailored to..." or any explanations about how the introduction was created
- Do NOT mention that any content was extracted from a resume or other document
- The document should appear as if it was written directly and personally by the candidate
- NEVER use generic percentages or metrics - only include specific numbers that appear in the resume
