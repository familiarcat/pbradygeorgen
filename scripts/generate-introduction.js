    const prompt = `
I need you to create a professional introduction based on the following resume content.
This introduction will be used as a cover letter that will be processed by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
as well as read by hiring managers. Format the output as markdown.

Resume Content:
${resumeContent}

User Information:
- Name: ${userName}
- Title: ${userTitle}
- Industry: ${userIndustry}
- Skills: ${userSkills.join(', ')}
- ATS Keywords: ${userKeywords.join(', ')}
- Email: ${userEmail}
- Phone: ${userPhone}
- Location: ${userLocation}

Please create a brief, pointed narrative-style introduction in the Salinger tradition that:
1. Starts with a title "# ${userName} - Introduction"
2. Uses a personal, conversational tone that feels authentic and human
3. Provides a concise glimpse of the candidate's career journey, core motivations, and aspirations
4. Weaves in 2-3 key skills naturally within the narrative flow
5. Expresses genuine passion for the industry in 1-2 impactful sentences
6. Includes a brief statement about what drives the candidate professionally
7. Subtly incorporates 3-5 industry-specific terms that will be recognized by ATS systems
8. Concludes with a brief statement about what the candidate is looking for in their next role

IMPORTANT: The entire introduction should be readable in about 20 seconds (approximately 150 words maximum, excluding the title). Focus on quality over quantity - every sentence should provide meaningful insight into the candidate's persona, goals, or motivations.

Salinger Narrative Style Guidelines:
- Write in first person with an authentic, distinctive voice
- Use natural language patterns that feel like genuine human writing
- Create a sense of intimacy and connection with the reader
- Include thoughtful reflections on experiences and what they've taught the candidate
- Express genuine enthusiasm and passion for the work
- Avoid clich√©s and corporate jargon when possible
- Balance professionalism with personality
- Show rather than tell about skills and capabilities
- Include small, specific details that make the narrative feel real and lived

ATS Optimization Guidelines (to be applied subtly):
- Naturally incorporate exact job title and skill keywords from the resume
- Include industry-specific technical terms, tools, and methodologies within the narrative
- Use both spelled-out terms and acronyms where it feels natural
- Ensure keyword density is natural (5-8% keyword density is optimal)
- Include both hard skills (technical abilities) and soft skills (communication, leadership)
- Match keywords to the candidate's industry and job level

Formatting Guidelines:
- Structure as a very concise, cohesive letter (approximately 150 words maximum)
- Use 2-3 short paragraphs total for the entire introduction
- Aim for 3-5 sentences per paragraph maximum
- Eliminate all unnecessary words and phrases
- Use no headings except for the title
- Use active voice and impactful, conversational language
- DO NOT use horizontal rules (---, ***, or ___) anywhere in the document
- Use one line break between paragraphs for readability
- NEVER use placeholder metrics or vague percentages
- Only include specific, concrete metrics if they appear in the resume and are truly impactful
- Prioritize statements about motivation, passion, and career goals over listing experiences

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT include any meta-commentary about the introduction itself
- Do NOT add any text like "This introduction is tailored to..." or any explanations about how the introduction was created
- Do NOT mention that any content was extracted from a resume or other document
- The document should appear as if it was written directly and personally by the candidate
- NEVER use generic percentages or metrics - only include specific numbers that appear in the resume
