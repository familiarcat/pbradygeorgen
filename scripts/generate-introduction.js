    // Create the prompt with Salinger narrative style and ATS optimization
    const prompt = `
I need you to create a professional introduction based on the following resume content.
This introduction will be used as a cover letter that will be processed by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
as well as read by hiring managers. Format the output as markdown.

Resume Content:
${resumeContent}

User Information:
- Name: ${userName}
- Title: ${userTitle}
- Industry: ${userIndustry}
- Skills: ${userSkills.join(', ')}
- ATS Keywords: ${userKeywords.join(', ')}
- Email: ${userEmail}
- Phone: ${userPhone}
- Location: ${userLocation}

Please create a brief, pointed narrative-style introduction that balances Salinger's storytelling with Kantian professional ethics:
1. Starts with a title "# ${userName} - Introduction"
2. Uses a personal yet professionally dignified tone that feels authentic and principled
3. Provides a concise glimpse of the candidate's career journey, emphasizing both duty and purpose
4. Weaves in 2-3 key skills naturally within the narrative flow
5. Expresses genuine commitment to universal professional principles in the industry
6. Includes a brief statement about the moral imperatives that drive the candidate professionally
7. Subtly incorporates 3-5 industry-specific terms that will be recognized by ATS systems
8. Concludes with a brief statement about the candidate's professional categorical imperative - what they must do in their next role

IMPORTANT: The entire introduction should be readable in about 20 seconds (approximately 150 words maximum, excluding the title). Focus on quality over quantity - every sentence should provide meaningful insight into the candidate's professional identity, ethical framework, and rational approach to their career.

Salinger-Kant Hybrid Style Guidelines:
- Write in first person with an authentic voice that conveys both personality and rational dignity
- Use concise, grammatically correct sentences (15-20 words maximum per sentence)
- Avoid run-on sentences, complex clauses, and excessive comma usage
- Create a sense of both connection with the reader and respect for universal professional standards
- Include thoughtful reflections on how experiences have shaped the candidate's professional duty and purpose
- Express genuine commitment to both the work itself and the ethical principles that guide it
- Avoid both clich√©s and overly theoretical language
- Balance personal narrative (Salinger) with universal principles (Kant)
- Show how the candidate's skills serve both personal fulfillment and a larger professional purpose
- Include specific details that demonstrate the candidate's commitment to acting according to principles that could be universal laws in their field
- Use active voice and strong verbs
- Vary sentence structure but maintain simplicity and clarity

ATS Optimization Guidelines (to be applied subtly):
- Naturally incorporate exact job title and skill keywords from the resume
- Include industry-specific technical terms, tools, and methodologies within the narrative
- Use both spelled-out terms and acronyms where it feels natural
- Ensure keyword density is natural (5-8% keyword density is optimal)
- Include both hard skills (technical abilities) and soft skills (communication, leadership)
- Match keywords to the candidate's industry and job level

Formatting Guidelines:
- Structure as a very concise, cohesive letter (approximately 150 words maximum)
- Use 2-3 short paragraphs total for the entire introduction
- Aim for 3-5 sentences per paragraph maximum
- Keep sentences short and direct (15-20 words maximum per sentence)
- Use simple sentence structures with minimal subordinate clauses
- Break complex ideas into multiple simple sentences
- Eliminate all unnecessary words and phrases
- Use no headings except for the title
- Use active voice and language that balances conversational tone with professional dignity
- DO NOT use horizontal rules (---, ***, or ___) anywhere in the document
- Use one line break between paragraphs for readability
- NEVER use placeholder metrics or vague percentages
- Only include specific, concrete metrics if they appear in the resume and are truly impactful
- Prioritize statements about professional duty, ethical principles, and universal standards in the field
- Include at least one statement that reflects Kant's categorical imperative - what the candidate believes all professionals in their field should do

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT include any meta-commentary about the introduction itself
- Do NOT add any text like "This introduction is tailored to..." or any explanations about how the introduction was created
- Do NOT mention that any content was extracted from a resume or other document
- The document should appear as if it was written directly and personally by the candidate
- NEVER use generic percentages or metrics - only include specific numbers that appear in the resume
