## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Extracting Content

There was an error extracting content from the current PDF file. This could be due to:

- The PDF file may be corrupted or in an unsupported format
- The PDF extraction process timed out
- There may be an issue with the server-side PDF processing

### Technical Details

${contentError ? `Error: ${contentError.message || 'Unknown error'}` : 'No content was extracted from the PDF'}

### Next Steps

- Try uploading a different PDF file
- Check the extraction logs for more details
- Contact the administrator if the problem persists

*This error message is shown instead of reverting to outdated content from a previous PDF file.*
