    "description": "A color theme strictly using only the colors extracted from the PDF: #66BBcc, #ccdddd, #783893, #777722, #444444, #884400, #000000, #000aaa, #111111. Following Derrida's philosophy of deconstruction, we've preserved the original colors without introducing external elements.",
    "harmony": "The theme establishes clear binary oppositions between primary and secondary elements, accentuating their roles.",
    "contrast": "Binary oppositions between text (#000000) and background (#111111) create meaningful contrast that emphasizes legibility and guides the user's attention. Primary (#66BBcc) and secondary (#444444) colors establish a clear hierarchy of interactive elements.",
    "accessibility": "The chosen colors ensure good accessibility and visibility, prioritizing user experience."
