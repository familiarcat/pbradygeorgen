    "harmony": "The primary-secondary contrast between #3366CC and #FFFFFF establishes a clear hierarchy, while the accent colors disrupt traditional patterns.",
    "contrast": "Binary oppositions between text (#000000) and background (#FFFFFF) create meaningful contrast that emphasizes legibility and guides the user's attention. Primary (#3366CC) and secondary (#FFFFFF) colors establish a clear hierarchy of interactive elements.",
