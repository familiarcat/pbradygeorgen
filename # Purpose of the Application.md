# Purpose of the Application

The purpose of this application is two fold - First it will serve as a web and mobile service to generate resumes referred to as the Resume Builder app. This will utilize a from based input system (Essentially a Wizard interface) that will utilize this user based input into the database to make a query to an AI API in order to compile the AI generated content into a legible and compelling Resume utilizing the records of a user's inputs that have been saved into the database. The database records will have a hierarchy based upon individual users and their resumes as will be described by the mongodb json schema. It will format the result so that it may create both a distinct public url for the completed resume for web viewing and sharing and also equal access to that functionality from a React Native mobile application so that users may browse the public resumes that have been created and eventually filter by content so that a user can search for a particular skill set and experience from the public resumes. There should be a level of security to only allow users who have created an account and saved their resumes in order to edit their personal content (aside from administrative access which will act as a superuser). This will allow the administrators to prune inappropriate content. There will be a need for a control panel for administrators.
The second (but primary) function is to present my own personal resume as the default resume and home page to be viewed. This will serve as the landing page offering my resume while showcasing the Resume Builder application. This home page will provide subsequent site navigation between this home page and the introduction to the Resume Builder app in both web and native platforms utilizing React Native. This is intended to utilize the "eat your own dog food" philosophy of using the Resume Builder itself to manage my resume and content. Essentially it will serve as both a platform for my freelance brand and showcase an example of a React Native app that utilizes the cutting edge of AI to build personal resumes.

# Tech Stack

This application will be written in Typescript for the React Native platform. It should adhere to common linting methods and will need to provide its source code to github. If possible, it should use the expo framework. Equally, if possible, it should use the Infinite Red "Ignite" framework. It will currently be hosted on AWS and may require access to AWS credentials and services based on scale (for instance utilizing AWS Lambda to trigger the AI compilation of the database data into a properly formatted AI query).

# Database

The database schema should be used to introspect object hierarchies and extract associations between record types based upon the nomenclature of the associated ID properties so that it will return a full record in JSON with the entirety of all related records and compile them into a single record for editing purposes in the response JSON. There may be another method to lazy load aspects of the associated record (i.e. related records to the individual view instead of all records at once) - this is intended for editing purposes. Unless a service is provided by the Workik platform to script and automate the compilation of necessarily associated records into a format that would generate an acceptable result compiled by the content of all associated records into a properly formatted Resume result, we will need to investigate AWS Lambda service calls that will read the appropriate combinations of records from the Workik database to compile them into an appropriate AI query and make a call to our AI resource from the AWS Lambda.

# Resume Builder Wizard

The Resume Builder should be a form based "Wizard styled" UX based UI builder that can be used to both create and edit aspects of a Resume. Users will have the option to log in as a gust or create their own account and sign in via that account in order to save and edit their Resume. It's initial UI on navigating to or signing in should default to a dashboard that views the current user's resumes by default such as a "My Resume" section. Below this should be a "Public Resumes" section that will allow the viewing and filtering of public Resumes on a tag based system that will eventually incorporate an "isTag" property to database schema and records. This will allow for users to search common tags as they are eventually architected into taggable records in order to search by. The form system should make sure to check that all fields that eventually will have a "required" property are fulfilled before submitting a newly created database or if a database has been modified to remove a required property, the user should be indicated of the conflict and now allowed to update the database with an incomplete record.
