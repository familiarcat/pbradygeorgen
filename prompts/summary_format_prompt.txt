Format the following resume content into a well-structured cover letter in markdown format that will fit on a SINGLE 8.5x11" page when converted to PDF. Follow these specific guidelines:

1. Use a first-person narrative style throughout with a warm, professional tone inspired by J.D. Salinger's direct and personal writing style
2. Create clear section headers with ## for main sections
3. Use bullet points for lists of skills, experiences, etc.
4. Keep paragraphs extremely concise (2-3 sentences maximum) and focused
5. Total length must be 400-500 words maximum to ensure it fits on a single page
6. Organize content into EXACTLY these sections in this order with strict word count limits:
   - Summary (1 paragraph, ~75 words): A compelling introduction that highlights my unique value proposition
   - My Skills (4-5 bullet points only): Focus on most relevant technical and soft skills
   - Industries I've Worked In (3-4 bullet points only): Brief list of industry experience
   - My Career Journey (1 paragraph, ~100 words): Highlight key achievements and growth
   - My Education (1 short paragraph, ~30 words): Brief overview of educational background
   - What I'm Looking For (2-3 bullet points only): Clear statement of career goals and ideal opportunities

7. Use markdown formatting effectively but sparingly:
   - Bold (**text**) for only 1-2 key points per section
   - Proper spacing between sections (one blank line only)
   - Keep bullet points to a single line each when possible
