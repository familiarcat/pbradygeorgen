# AlexAI Spirit Reincarnation (Katra)

## Current Project State

AlexAI is a Next.js application deployed on AWS Amplify that extracts content from PDF files to generate summaries and downloadable markdown files. The application extracts visual elements, content, colors, and fonts from PDFs to create adaptive interfaces.

## Current Issues

We're experiencing issues with the PDF preview and download functionality in the Cover Letter feature:

1. **Font Application Issues**: The fonts from the extracted PDF styles are not being properly applied to the PDF preview.
2. **Text Alignment Issues**: The text in the PDF should be left-aligned but appears to have alignment issues.
3. **Spacing Issues**: Text vertically overlaps in the generated PDFs.
4. **Random Bold Cases**: The markdown has random bold cases applied throughout the content.
5. **Color Extraction Issues**: The color extraction script is not properly extracting colors from PDFs (returns 0 colors).

## Changes Made So Far

### 1. Fixed Markdown Parsing

- Updated the `cleanMarkdownFormatting` function in `PdfGenerator.ts` to properly handle bold formatting
- Improved handling of nested formatting (bold, italic, code blocks)
- Enhanced paragraph handling for proper spacing and formatting

### 2. Fixed Text Alignment and Spacing

- Added explicit left alignment to all text rendering in the PDF
- Increased line spacing to prevent text overlap
- Adjusted margins and positioning for better readability
- Optimized spacing between different elements (headings, paragraphs, list items)

### 3. Fixed Font Application

- Ensured extracted fonts are properly applied to the PDF preview
- Added proper font fallbacks for standard PDF fonts (courier, helvetica, times)
- Updated the StyledMarkdown component for proper font application

### 4. Fixed Color Extraction

- Updated extract-pdf-colors.js to add default colors when no colors are found
- Ensured extracted colors are properly applied to generated PDFs

### 5. Improved Styling Consistency

- Updated StyledMarkdown component for consistent styling across all elements
- Added explicit text alignment to all elements
- Increased spacing between elements for better readability

## Key Files Modified

1. **utils/PdfGenerator.ts**
   - Updated markdown parsing and PDF generation functions
   - Fixed font application and text alignment
   - Improved spacing and formatting

2. **components/StyledMarkdown.tsx**
   - Updated styling for consistent font application
   - Added explicit text alignment to all elements

3. **scripts/extract-pdf-colors.js**
   - Added fallback colors when extraction fails
   - Fixed RGBA color extraction

4. **components/SummaryModal.tsx**
   - Updated PDF generation options to use extracted styles

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Changes in Browser**: Despite successful builds, changes aren't visible in the browser. Need to investigate caching or other issues.

2. **Test with Different PDFs**: Verify theme adaptation with various PDFs.

3. **Refine Color Extraction**: Implement more sophisticated color extraction algorithm.

4. **Improve Font Handling**: Add support for more font families and better fallbacks.

5. **Document Changes**: Update documentation to reflect new styling approach.

## Philosophical Framework

The application follows four philosophical frameworks:
- **Salinger**: Intuitive UX with consistent visual language
- **Hesse**: Mathematical color theory
- **Derrida**: Deconstructing hardcoded values with CSS variables
- **Dante**: Methodical logging and organization

## Technical Details

- The PDF extraction process happens during the build process
- PDF-extracted styles should be applied to all components including Introduction PDFs
- The application uses CSS variables to apply PDF-extracted styles
- The Introduction PDF should use the same styling as the rest of the application

## Katra Transfer Complete
